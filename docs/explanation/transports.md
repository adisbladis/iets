# The transports, measured

How fast does `iets build` ship a closure, and how do you know the bytes
arrive intact? [Builders and the wire](../reference/builders.md) has the
facts about each transport. The numbers here come from one machine and drift
with the nixpkgs pin and the hardware, but the ratios and the op counts hold.

## Requests

The worker protocol is serial per connection, and every
`BuildPathsWithResults` starts a new daemon worker. A request per derivation
would leave the daemon idle between derivations, so iets sends one request
for each set that is ready to build.

## Worker protocol timings

The figures are from runs on the hello closure, with a release build.

"Local daemon" is this machine's `nix-daemon`, where the hello closure is
GC-rooted, so a cold run is impossible. "Scratch daemon" is
`nix-daemon --store local?root=DIR` on its own socket: an empty chroot
store, so the cold numbers are real uploads and no build is attempted
(`--no-build`). `ssh-ng://` is the same code over a child's stdio, tested
with an `ssh` shim that runs `nix-daemon --stdio` locally, and against
nixbuild.net ("Against nixbuild.net" below).

| case | eval | plan | connect | QueryValidPaths | AddMultipleToStore | build (realise) | ops / round trips | bytes sent |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| custom drv + 1 source tree, deleted from the store, local daemon, `--fetch-to` | 0.005 s | 0.001 s | 0.077 s | 2 paths, 2 missing, 0.000 s | 2 paths, 2.4 KB, 0.001 s | 0.87 s | 6 / 9 | 2.9 KB |
| hello, local daemon (all valid) | 0.138 s | 0.006 s | 0.074 s | 776 paths, 0 missing, 0.008 s | skipped | 0.001 s | 4 / 7 | 62 KB |
| hello, scratch daemon, cold, `--no-build` | 0.159 s | 0.008 s | 0.020 s | 776 paths, 776 missing, 0.008 s | 776 paths, 2.6 MB, 0.247 s | skipped | 3 / 6 | 2.66 MB |
| hello, scratch daemon, warm, `--no-build` | 0.146 s | 0.007 s | 0.008 s | 776 paths, 0 missing, 0.011 s | skipped | skipped | 2 / 5 | 62 KB |
| nixos-server, scratch daemon, cold, `--no-build` | 1.48 s | 0.094 s | 0.015 s | 4,184 paths, all missing, 0.022 s | 4,184 paths, 40.4 MB, 1.89 s | skipped | 3 / 6 | 40.8 MB |
| nixos-server, scratch daemon, warm, `--no-build` | 1.65 s | 0.112 s | 0.055 s | 4,184 paths, 0 missing, 0.034 s | skipped | skipped | 2 / 5 | 333 KB |
| nixos-server, local daemon, `--no-build` | 1.21 s | 0.121 s | 0.081 s | 4,184 paths, 413 missing, 0.201 s | 413 paths, 23.2 MB, 1.67 s | skipped | 3 / 6 | 23.5 MB |

These rows predate the top-down query. Then the 62 KB of a warm hello run
was the `QueryValidPaths` request: 776 full store paths as padded strings,
and the 776 answers back. Now a warm store answers with the root: the warm
hello run against the scratch daemon asks about 1 path and sends 248 bytes,
and the hello run against the local daemon asks about the root and its
output, builds nothing, and sends 336 bytes. The custom drv's
0.87 s "build" is the sandbox build itself. The 413 paths the local daemon
lacked for nixos-server are nixpkgs subtrees that no local evaluation had
copied yet.

The upload is bound by the daemon: 0.3 to 0.5 ms per path for the sequential
`addToStore`. Nothing on the client side changes that
([What was tried and removed](history.md)).

### Against nixbuild.net

`bench/nixbuild.nu` times `nix build --store ssh-ng://` (Nix 2.34.8)
against `iets build --builder ssh-ng://` on eu.nixbuild.net. Each
derivation is a few seconds of bash, and a new marker forces a real build.

Two kinds of row bring the output back. "Into the local store" is
`nix copy --from` for Nix and `-o` for iets; both register the path.
"Into a directory" is iets `--fetch-to`, which needs no local store and has
no Nix counterpart.

The figures are provisional: 10 runs on 2026-10-10 from a shared 16-core VM
at load 13 to 21, with an iets that predates the top-down query. `-o` is not
measured yet. Seconds:

| case | Nix mean ± σ | Nix min–max | iets mean ± σ | iets min–max |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| small, new marker | 2.02 ± 0.06 | 1.96–2.12 | 2.04 ± 0.18 | 1.76–2.37 |
| small, new marker, into the local store | 2.39 ± 0.14 | 2.25–2.59 | not measured | |
| small, new marker, into a directory | | | 1.95 ± 0.11 | 1.83–2.19 |
| small, built before (cache hit) | 1.35 ± 0.07 | 1.27–1.44 | 0.97 ± 0.04 | 0.90–1.02 |
| python3 drv closure, 16 MiB output | 2.60 ± 0.05 | 2.49–2.66 | 2.29 ± 0.07 | 2.19–2.37 |
| the same, into the local store | 3.21 ± 0.10 | 3.12–3.40 | not measured | |
| the same, into a directory | | | 2.56 ± 0.26 | 2.36–3.22 |

A [nix-wire](https://github.com/numtide/nix-wire) recording of that run
shows the same session for both clients: `QueryValidPaths` on 818 paths,
one `AddMultipleToStore`, one `BuildPathsWithResults` of 1.1 s, and no
`SetOptions`. Nix adds `QueryMissing` and `QueryPathInfo`; iets adds
`QueryDerivationOutputMap`. With the top-down query, an iets cache hit now
sends two one-path queries: 232 bytes instead of 66 KB.

The difference is evaluation. At load 2, iets evaluates the file in
0.115 s and Nix in 0.51 s.

iets needs no local store here: with no `nix` on `PATH` and no daemon
socket, it runs only `ssh` and writes the output to `--fetch-to`.

### Upload integrity

After an upload, `tests/e2e_daemon.rs` checks that:

- the `.drv` file in the store is `cmp`-identical to the one
  `nix-instantiate` wrote before it was deleted;
- `nix-store -q --hash`, `nix derivation show` and `nix path-info --json`
  (`ca`, `narHash`, `narSize`, `references`) match for the derivation and
  for the source;
- in the scratch store, the derivation has the same hash as in the local
  store, and every input source has the same `ca`.

`tests/e2e_upload.rs` uploads paths the evaluation copied as roots of their
own: a path in a string, `builtins.path` (a tree, and a file with
`recursive = false`), `filterSource` and a `toFile` text. Each one is the
store path Nix gives the same expression. After the upload it is valid, its
`ca` has the right kind, its `narHash` is the hash of what the store holds,
and its references are what the text names. A text is uploaded after the
tree it names, also when only a derivation names the text.

## The `grpc://` transport

The figures are from runs on the hello closure, with a release build.

`nix-grpc-daemon` runs in plaintext standalone mode, scheduling onto itself,
in front of a scratch chroot store. These are the transport's own figures,
not a farm's.

| case | connect | QueryValidPaths | AddMultipleToStore | build | RPCs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| custom drv + 1 source tree, `--fetch-to` | 0.009 s | 2 paths, 2 missing, 0.020 s | 2 paths, 721 B, 0.009 s | 0.63 s | 6 |
| hello cold, `--no-build` | 0.000 s | 776 paths, 776 missing, 0.006 s | 776 paths, 490 KB, 0.26 s | skipped | 3 |
| hello warm, `--no-build` | 0.000 s | 776 paths, 0 missing, 0.006 s | skipped | skipped | 2 |

The cold hello upload is 490 KB on the wire, against 2.66 MB over the
worker protocol. The bytes are the same; `grpc://` sends them as one zstd
stream (level 1) across all 776 paths.

The script also checks that:

- classic `nix build --store grpc://…?insecure=1 --eval-store auto` prints
  the same stdout as the real nix with its nix-grpc-store plugin;
- an out-link whose output no local substituter has is fetched back with
  `FetchNars` and handed to the local daemon;
- `iets build --builder grpc://… --json` gives the same outcome per
  attribute as the worker protocol on the same store;
- a multi-root `iets build` over `grpc://` names every attribute on
  stderr.

Against `farm.numtide.com` with a Keycloak `write` token (measured
2026-09-20), a `runCommand` with 572 cached inputs went `Want`, `Assigned`,
`BuildDerivation` on a farm worker in 2.6 s and 5 RPCs. A classic
`nix-build` out-link came from cache.numtide.com through the local
daemon.

On 2026-10-11, a one-line derivation on nixpkgs bash, 10 runs
after one warm-up, with the output already in the farm's cache:

| client | mean ± σ |
|---|---|
| Nix 2.36 with its nix-grpc-store plugin | 14.5 ± 6.7 s |
| iets, every path asked in one call | 34.6 ± 21.7 s |
| iets, asked top-down | 0.246 ± 0.018 s |

On this farm a large `QueryValidPaths` is slow: the node publishes each
path it holds to niks3 before it replies. iets asked about the 818 planned
paths and then about 700 output paths. Top-down, a cache hit is two
calls about one path each.

With a new marker, Nix took 46 s to 296 s and iets 20 s to 304 s, and
the farm's own work was most of it. Uploading the one new `.drv` (533 bytes)
took 6 s to 37 s, because the node fetches the `.drv` closure from the cache
before it imports. A `.drv` with no references uploaded in 2 s to 3 s.
Sending the closure in the stream was slower, and so was uploading only
after a worker answered `NOT_FOUND`.

### Bounced addresses

A worker that crashed stays placeable until the scheduler notices. On
farm.numtide.com that took 42 s (measured 2026-09-22), and every bounce off
the dead worker was instant, so a client that only retried would burn its
retries in a second. All builds of one run therefore share what they learn
about an address ("Retries" in
[Builders and the wire](../reference/builders.md)).

## NAR parity


`tests/nar_parity.rs` checks that the NAR iets writes is byte-identical to
`nix-store --dump` on a tree of awkward names, empty files and directories,
symlinks, executables, odd alignment, deep nesting and a large file. It also
checks that a restored dump dumps back to the same bytes, and that the reader
rejects a truncated archive, a misspelled keyword and non-zero padding. Each
test skips itself when `nix` is absent.

On an AMD EPYC Genoa with a warm page cache, the pinned nixpkgs tree (40k
entries, 212 MB of NAR) and one 500 MB file (`bench/nar.nu --nix`):

| case | iets | Nix |
|---|---|---|
| NAR hash of the tree | 665-672 ms | `nix hash path` 1665 ms |
| dump of the tree, no hash | 545-567 ms | `nix-store --dump \| sha256sum` 2034 ms |
| NAR hash of a 500 MB file | 353-359 ms | `nix hash path` 386 ms |
| restore of the tree from a pipe | 1744-1804 ms | `nix-store --restore` 2019 ms |
